# 프로젝트 라이브러리 review

Review this local page with `better-layout`. Read `app/PRODUCT.md`, inspect `app/index.html`, `app/styles.css` and `app/app.js`, then inspect the rendered page using Playwright CLI. This is a review request: do not edit application files.

Serve the `app/` directory locally, for example with `python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory app` (choose another free port if needed). Open that localhost URL in a fresh named Playwright CLI session. Keep this case independent from the other cases.

Inspect the library at 1280px, 768px and 320px and check text enlargement. Explore the recommended documents. Review reading order and the ability to find and reach each action; preserve the established spacing tokens.

Use up to three minutes for this bounded page. Report actual findings with source locations and relevant runtime observations, then a scoped verdict. State which checks could not be completed. Do not infer a failure merely from a preferred style, and do not infer a pass from source alone when the claim depends on browser behavior. No source changes or external services are needed.
