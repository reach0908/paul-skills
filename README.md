# Paul Skills

A human-in-the-loop skill library, forked from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). It keeps the upstream bucket layout, writing guidance, docs, router, and Changesets release process, then adds source tracking and observable evaluations.

Paul Skills uses its own version sequence starting at **0.1.0**, with release tags named `paul-skills@<version>`. Upstream revisions are tracked separately. See the [version policy](docs/maintenance.md#independent-versions).

- [Maintenance process](docs/maintenance.md): create, evaluate, review, release, and verify installation.
- [Source inventory](skill-sources.json): exact origin commits, paths, licenses, and review baselines for every skill.
- [Evaluation protocol](evals/README.md): behavior evidence, model selection, and cost reporting.
- [Scope](SCOPE.md): small skills, human decisions, and bounded migration.

## Installation

This fork uses its own marketplace. It is not listed in `claude-plugins-official`. Choose either the plugin or editable skills per host; installing both duplicates skill names. Marketplace installation and updates are separate from upstream source reconciliation.

## Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add reach0908/paul-skills
claude plugin install paul-skills@paul-skills
```

To update manually:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update paul-skills
claude plugin update paul-skills@paul-skills
```

Custom-marketplace auto-update is a host setting. Enable it for `paul-skills` in `/plugin` > Marketplaces if desired; do not assume the official marketplace's defaults apply to this fork.

## Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add reach0908/paul-skills
codex plugin add paul-skills@paul-skills
```

The host manages the installed bundle. Release versions come from `package.json` and are synchronized to the plugin manifest. Inspect the installed version after an update; source HEAD alone does not prove activation in an existing session.

## Editable or individual skills

```bash
npx skills@latest add reach0908/paul-skills --skill tdd
```

For other skills, replace `tdd` with the desired name. Run `npx skills@latest update` for existing installs; re-run `add` for new skills. These editable copies need manual updates.

Inherited engineering flows still use `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` and `/ask-matt`; those names are retained for compatibility.

## Reference

These split on one axis: who can invoke them. **User-invoked** skills are reachable only when you type them (e.g. `/grill-me`); their job is to orchestrate. **Model-invoked** skills can be invoked by you _or_ reached for automatically by the agent when the task fits; they hold the reusable discipline. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but never another user-invoked one.

### Engineering

Skills I use daily for code work.

**User-invoked**

- **[ask-matt](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./skills/engineering/triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-matt-pocock-skills](./skills/engineering/setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md)**: Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo before using the other engineering skills.
- **[to-spec](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker. No interview, just synthesizes what you've already discussed.
- **[to-tickets](./skills/engineering/to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges, written as text in a local file, or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./skills/engineering/implement/SKILL.md)**: Build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving `/tdd` at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review` before committing.
- **[implement-spec](./skills/engineering/implement-spec/SKILL.md)**: Implement a whole spec on one integration branch. Works the tickets as a task graph, running implementer subagents across the ready frontier for maximum concurrency, then closes out with `/code-review`.
- **[wayfinder](./skills/engineering/wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Plan a huge chunk of work, more than one agent session can hold, as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, and resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.
- **[retro](./skills/engineering/retro/SKILL.md)**: Suggest improvements to the coding agent's environment (navigation, automated checks, coding standards, steering files, tooling) after a session, most severe first.

**Model-invoked**

- **[prototype](./skills/engineering/prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question, either a single shareable HTML file for state/logic questions, or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route.
- **[diagnosing-bugs](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix → regression-test.
- **[research](./skills/engineering/research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md)**: Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./skills/engineering/domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model: challenge terms against the glossary, stress-test with edge-case scenarios, and update `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./skills/engineering/codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface.
- **[code-review](./skills/engineering/code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents so neither pollutes the other.
- **[pr](./skills/engineering/pr/SKILL.md)**: The shape a pull request body should take: a summary as the smallest visual that makes the change clear, before/after evidence that it works, and a merge-danger call (one-way or two-way door, plus blast radius).
- **[wizard](./skills/engineering/wizard/SKILL.md)**: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.

### Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

**User-invoked**

- **[grill-me](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md)**: Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[handoff](./skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md)**: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document so another agent can continue the work.
- **[teach](./skills/productivity/teach/SKILL.md)**: Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[to-questionnaire](./skills/productivity/to-questionnaire/SKILL.md)**: Turn a decision you can't answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can, filled in async, or together over a meeting. It grills you about the send (who it's for, what you need back), not the subject.
- **[wait-what](./skills/productivity/wait-what/SKILL.md)**: Fire this the moment a message doesn't land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you're missing, in plain English, using your `GLOSSARY.md` vocabulary.

**Model-invoked**

- **[grilling](./skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md)**: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea until every branch of the design tree is resolved. The reusable interview primitive behind `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `triage`, `wayfinder` and `improve-codebase-architecture`.
- **[writing-for-agents](./skills/productivity/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)**: Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.
